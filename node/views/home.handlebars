<p><strong>Get Back in Time</strong> is an app for the Pebble smart watch.
You can use it to find your way back from your hiking trip, locate your parked car or
just see how far you have traveled from a certain point. Just long-press SELECT on your
Pebble and your target is stored.</p>

</a></div>

<p>The app allows you to store any amount of locations, which are pushed into your
personal Pebble Timeline. You can browse your Timeline to find a location you wish
to return to. Your Pebble will show you the heading and distance to your target. It
uses the compass to show you which way to go and colors to indicate whether you're
approaching your target or moving away from it. The target is stored so that you can
use other Pebble apps in the mean time and when you return to Get Back in Time you
will see up-to-date heading and distance to your target.</p>

<p>The app works even if your Pebble doesn't yet have the Timeline functionality. In
that case only one target can be set.</p>

<h2>Advanced usage</h2>
<p>You can set targets also using the form below or via an API. Just POST a JSON object
with <tt>position</tt> element in the root level, and a new pin will be pushed to your
Timeline. The object will be pushed to the Pebble Timeline. If you insert a <tt>pin</tt>
element (<a href="http://developer.getpebble.com/guides/timeline/pin-structure/">see 
Timeline Pin Structure</a>) to your JSON object, it will be passed on as is. Otherwise
a new pin with some basic properties is created automatically. <tt>Open Watch App</tt>
action is added to all pins.</p>
<h3>Your personal tokens</h3>
<p>You need an account token in order to send locations to the server. In order to push
pins to Pebble's timeline, you also need a timeline token. You can get your personal
tokens from the watch app's configuration page. Open the Pebble app in your phone,
select <tt>SETTINGS</tt> (or the gear icon) for <tt>Get Back in Time</tt> app and scroll
to the end of the configuration screen.</p>

<h3>Minimal JSON</h3>
<code>{
  "position": {
    "coords": {
      "latitude": 60.9,
      "longitude": 24.1
    }
  },
}
</code>
<h3>Example API call with JavaScript</h3>
<code>// place your own account token here!
var userToken = '<span class="codetoken">{{userToken}}</span>';
// add your timeline token here
var timelineToken = '<span class="codetoken">{{timelineToken}}</span>';
var url = 'http://getback.pebbletime.io/' + userToken + '/place/new';
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = function() {
  console.log(this.responseText);
};
req.open("POST", url, true);
req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
function success(position) {
  var obj = {
    "position": {
      "coords": {
        "latitude": position.coords.latitude,
        "longitude": position.coords.longitude
      }
    },
    "timelineToken": timelineToken
  };
  req.send(JSON.stringify(obj));
}
window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success);

<h3>API usage restrictions</h3>
<p>The API currently runs on a free <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>
instance and has "best effort" service level. Please test your implementations on your
own environment in order to minimize the load to the API server. If you want better
service level or if you plan to automatically push more than a dozen locations per day
to your timeline, consider implementing your own API server. You can start by cloning
<a href="https://github.com/samuelmr/pebble-getbackintime">the code on Github</a>.</p>
